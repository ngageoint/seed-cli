Executes Seed compliant Docker image over multiple iterations

Related to the run command, the seed batch command will run an image multiple times with varying inputs. It will take an image name and either a directory with files to use as input or a csv file specifying keys and files (preferred).

seed batch -in IMAGE_NAME [-b BATCH_FILE | -d BATCH_DIRECTORY] [-e SETTING=SETTING_VALUE] [-m MOUNT_KEY=HOST_PATH] [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]

*-in, -imageName* ::
    Docker image name to run; Required argument.
*-b, -batch* ::
    Optional file specifying input keys and file mapping for batch processing. Supersedes directory flag.  
*-d, -directory* ::
    Alternative to batch file; Specifies a directory of files to batch process (default is current directory).
*-e, -setting* ::
    Specifies the key/value setting values of the seed spec in the format SETTING_KEY=VALUE.
*-m, -mount* ::
    Specifies the key/value mount values of the seed spec in the format MOUNT_KEY=HOST_PATH.
*-o, -outDir* ::
    Specifies the job output directory.
*-rm* ::
    Automatically removes the container when the job exits (i.e. docker run --rm)
*-s, -schema* ::
    External Seed metadata schema file; Overrides built in schema to validate side-car metadata files

*EXAMPLE:* + 
For a Seed interface with two inputData.files elements with a name of MY_INPUT and MY_INPUT2 the seed batch command would be as follows:

seed batch -in process-file:0.1.0-seed:0.1.0 -b batch.csv -o /tmp/outputs

And the batch.csv file would look something like this:

MY_INPUT, MY_INPUT2
/path/to/input1.txt, input2.txt
/path/to/different/input.txt, input2.txt
currentDirectoryInput.txt, input2.txt

The image will be run three times and success or failure will be reported for each run along with the location of any output.
